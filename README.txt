INTELO
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This is one of the freest codes of personal voice assistance you will see soon. 
We are working on it. But you know for sure all the code is not yet added here 
we still testing stuff, we are inviting you, we want you aboard.

This software work with speak for the voice and W3M as a CLI browser you can find 
them easily through the internet. I write it with shell code just for optimization of 
resources with the aim of reducing the number of code 
lines but you can translate it from shell to another one.

Intelo wishes to be a voice assistance AI by Futurists inc, which searches for you any 
information online but give you the answer with an interactive voice.
We are starting with Wikipedia searching by the time to be able to cover more internet 
possibilities.

Intelo is a CopyLeft Software under GPL license.

Use Intelo just by writing what you are looking for and the code will find it for you.
You can use this code but don't forget to contribute regarding the GPL license and send us an
email or just use GitHub.We are looking to set up a realistic voice (based on C, using 
espeak or another), creating an API and also to optimize the code by adding new possibilities 
or interaction.


One simple way to do so

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Run the intelo2.sh file and it will invite you by voice to make some research and then you can write whatever you want, 
the code will look for it and read it by voice for you.

INTELO code is the most simple one. For sure will have no problem using it and contributing.
if you know some shell, you can reformat the text found by INTELO, you can remove the useless 
and readjust it with the number of lines or anything you think can be helpful or useful for I
NTELO to be more powerful than now. I can do it but I want you to contribute.

Don't forget first install speak and all the software need (for example I use the Linux ubuntu 
distribution for the test): 
If you are a developer you will have no problem finding them. Just take time to read the code
they are all free.

That is your test. 


How to send all the modifications you made
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Great, you can do so easily by sending an email or contacting me, use the information just on the top.
Now intelo is ours (You and me)! alone we can Well We do more by sharing and exchanging knowledge together!


Thanks
