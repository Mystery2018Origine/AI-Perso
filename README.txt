INTELO
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This is one of the most free code of personal voice assistance you will see soon. 
We are working for it . But you know for sure all the code is not yet added here 
we still testing stuff, we are inviting you, we want you aboard.

This software work with espeak for the voice and W3M as a CLI browser you can find 
them easily through internet.I write it with shell code just for optimisation of 
resources with the aim to reduice the number of code 
line but you can translate it from shell to an other one.

Intelo wish to be a voice assistance AI by Futurists inc, which search for you any 
information online but give you th answer with an interactif voice.
We are starting with wikipedia searching by the aime to be able to cover more internet 
possibilities.

Intelo is a CopyLeft Software under GPL license.

Use Intelo just by writting what you are looking for and the code will find it for you.
You can use this code but don't forget to contridute regarding the GPL license send us an
email or just use GITHUB.We are looking to setup a realistic voice (based on C, using 
espeak or another),creating an API and also to optimise the code by adding new possibilities 
or interation.


One Easy way to do so
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Run the intelo2.sh file and it will invite you by voice to make a reseach and them you 
can write whatever you want, the code will look for it and read it by voice for you.

INTELO code is the most simple one. For sur will have no problem to use it and contibute.
if you know some shell, you can reformat the text find by INTELO, you can remove the useless 
and reajust it with the number of line or anything you think can be helpful or useful for I
NTELO to be more power that now.I can do it but I want you to contribute.

Don't forget first install espeak and all the software need (for example I use linux ubuntu 
distribution for the test): 
If you are a developper you will have no problem to find them. Just take time to read the code
they are all free.

That is your test. 


How to send all the modification you made
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Great, you can do so easy by sending an email or contacting me, use the information just on the top.

Now intelo is ours (You and me)!
alone we can Well but We do more by share and exchnaging knowledge together!


Thanks
